<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) can be classified into two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses pressure sensors mounted on each tire to directly measure the air pressure and send real-time data to the vehicle's onboard computer. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, calculates tire pressure based on factors such as wheel speed and rotational differences. Both systems help drivers maintain optimal tire pressure, improve fuel efficiency, and enhance overall safety on the road.</p></p>
