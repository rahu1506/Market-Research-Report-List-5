<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specular Microscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Specular Microscope</li><li>Non-contact Specular Microscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact specular microscopes require physical contact with the corneal surface in order to obtain high-resolution images of corneal endothelial cells. These microscopes are commonly used in clinical settings for assessing corneal health and monitoring conditions such as Fuchs' dystrophy. Non-contact specular microscopes, on the other hand, use a non-invasive technique to capture images of the cornea without touching the eye. This type of microscope is preferred in some cases due to its ability to reduce the risk of infection and patient discomfort.</p></p>
