<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Cardiac Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Eft Ventricle Pacemaker</li><li>Right Ventricle Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter Cardiac Pacemaker includes two main types: Left Ventricle Pacemaker and Right Ventricle Pacemaker. Left Ventricle Pacemakers are used to treat heart failure by stimulating the left ventricle to improve heart function. Right Ventricle Pacemakers are commonly used to treat atrioventricular block, a condition where the electrical signals between the atria and ventricles are disrupted. Both types of pacemakers are placed through a minimally invasive procedure called transcatheter implantation, which offers a less invasive alternative to traditional surgery.</p></p>
