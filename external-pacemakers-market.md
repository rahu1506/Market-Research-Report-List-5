<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemaker</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single chamber pacemakers are devices that use only one lead wire to regulate the heart's lower chambers (ventricles). These pacemakers are commonly used for patients with bradycardia or other similar conditions. On the other hand, dual chamber pacemakers utilize two lead wires to monitor and regulate both the upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. This type of pacemaker is typically used for patients with conditions that require more precise coordination between the two chambers.</p></p>
