<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arterial Incision Closure Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Closure Devices</li><li>Active Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive closure devices are designed to provide gradual, natural closure of arterial incisions by applying pressure to the site. These devices typically involve a collagen plug or similar material that promotes the formation of a blood clot to seal the incision. Active closure devices, on the other hand, use mechanical means to quickly and efficiently close arterial incisions. This may involve sutures, clips, or other devices that physically secure the incision site. Both types of closure devices serve the same purpose of effectively sealing arterial incisions after medical procedures.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Arterial Incision Closure Device Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Procedures by Femoral Arterial Access</li><li>Procedures by Transradial Arterial Access</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arterial Incision Closure Devices are used in procedures performed through femoral arterial access, where a small incision is made in the groin area to access the artery. These devices help in closing the incision post-procedure, reducing the risk of bleeding. Similarly, they are also used in procedures performed through transradial arterial access, where the artery in the wrist is accessed. The use of these devices in both types of procedures highlights their versatility and importance in ensuring patient safety during vascular interventions.</p></p>
