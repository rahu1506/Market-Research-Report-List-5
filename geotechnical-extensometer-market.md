<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geotechnical Extensometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ROD EXTENSOMETERS</li><li>PROBE EXTENSOMETERS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rod extensometers and probe extensometers are two common types of geotechnical extensometers used for measuring ground movement and deformation. Rod extensometers consist of a series of vertical rods installed in boreholes to monitor changes in the ground, while probe extensometers use a probe inserted into the ground to measure deformations. Both types provide valuable data for assessing the stability of slopes, tunnels, and underground structures. Rod extensometers are typically more suitable for long-term monitoring, while probe extensometers are used for short-term measurements.</p></p>
