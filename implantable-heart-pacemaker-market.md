<p><strong>The Implantable Heart Pacemaker Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heart Block</li><li>Sick Sinus Syndrome</li><li>Diagnosing Heart Diseases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable heart pacemakers are used in the treatment of heart block, sick sinus syndrome, and diagnosing heart diseases. Heart block is a condition where the electrical signals in the heart are delayed or blocked, often resulting in a slower heart rate. Sick sinus syndrome refers to an irregular heartbeat caused by dysfunction of the sinus node. Implantable heart pacemakers help regulate the heart's rhythm and improve cardiac function in patients with these conditions, ultimately contributing to better heart health and quality of life.</p></p>
