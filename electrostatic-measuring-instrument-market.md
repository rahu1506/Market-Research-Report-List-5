<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Measuring Instrument Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contacting</li><li>Contacting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrostatic measuring instruments can be categorized into two main types: non-contacting and contacting. Non-contacting instruments utilize sensors that do not come into direct contact with the object being measured, making them suitable for delicate or sensitive materials. These instruments typically use capacitance or electrostatic field sensors to measure parameters like distance, thickness, or surface irregularities. On the other hand, contacting instruments require physical contact with the object and can provide more precise measurements, such as surface roughness or hardness.</p></p>
