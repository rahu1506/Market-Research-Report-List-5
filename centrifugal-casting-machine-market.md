<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Casting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum</li><li>Non-vacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal casting machines can be categorized into Vacuum and Non-vacuum types based on their operation method. In Vacuum centrifugal casting machines, a vacuum is used to eliminate trapped gas and air bubbles, resulting in a higher quality casting with fewer defects. Non-vacuum centrifugal casting machines, on the other hand, rely solely on centrifugal force to push the molten metal into the mold cavity. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different applications depending on the desired quality and production requirements.</p></p>
