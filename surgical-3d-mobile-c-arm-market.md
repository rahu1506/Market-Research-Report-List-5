<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical 3D Mobile C-Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isocentric C-arms</li><li>Non Isocentric C-arms</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical 3D mobile C-arms are categorized into two main types: isocentric C-arms and non-isocentric C-arms. Isocentric C-arms have a fixed pivot point which allows the image receptor and X-ray tube to rotate around the patient in a concentric manner, providing consistent imaging quality. On the other hand, non-isocentric C-arms do not have a fixed pivot point, resulting in variable imaging quality depending on the positioning of the machine. Each type has its own advantages and limitations, catering to different surgical needs and preferences.</p></p>
