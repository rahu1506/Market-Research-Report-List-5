<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Veno-Arterial</li><li>Arterio-Venous</li><li>Veno-Venous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support system that provides cardiac and/or respiratory support to patients with severe heart or lung failure. There are three main types of ECMO configurations: Veno-Arterial ECMO, Arterio-Venous ECMO, and Veno-Venous ECMO. Veno-Arterial ECMO involves draining blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and returning it to an artery to support both the heart and lungs. Arterio-Venous ECMO involves oxygenating blood outside the body and returning it to a vein to support the heart. Veno-Venous ECMO involves oxygenating blood outside the body and returning it to a vein to support the lungs.</p></p>
