<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorine Doped Tin Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N-Type</li><li>P-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorine Doped Tin Oxide (FTO) market consists of two main types: N-Type and P-Type. N-Type FTO is doped with elements that provide an excess of free electrons, resulting in a material that conducts electricity easily. This type is commonly used in applications requiring good electrical conductivity, such as solar cells and touchscreens. On the other hand, P-Type FTO is doped with elements that create electron holes, making it less conductive. This type is often used in electronic devices where control of conductivity is important.</p></p>
