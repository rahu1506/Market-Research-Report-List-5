<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulsed Electric Field Ablation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Electroporation Technology</li><li>Irreversible Electroporation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pulsed Electric Field Ablation System includes two main types of technology: Reversible Electroporation (RE) and Irreversible Electroporation (IRE). RE technology uses controlled electric pulses to temporarily increase the permeability of cell membranes, allowing for the delivery of molecules into the cells. On the other hand, IRE technology uses high-voltage pulses to create irreversible pores in cell membranes, leading to cell death. Both technologies have applications in the medical field for procedures such as cancer treatment and gene therapy.</p></p>
